1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?
Talk 22, WebGL.
Nice figures and PPT slides presented. Maybe this is becasue that WebGL itself is more about graphics.

Talk 24, WebAssembly.
I myself delievered this presentaion. I did do some research and spend much time in this topic. As a result, I learnt a lot on WebAssembly, which could be found in my paper if you are interested.

3. Which talk did you like the best and why?
Talk 16, Vue.js.
Logic flow on why use vue.js, and how it outperforms others does make sense.
