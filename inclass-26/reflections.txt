1. Why do I love this course?

The course material is awesome. Like you said in class, I thought it's just a web development course at the very beginning, but later I realized how wrong I was. Front-end development is also very challenging. All these up-to-date technologies, ES6, Node.js, React/Redux, back-end services, are really really fiscinating. 

The web application we have been building is the best project experience I have ever had (I definitely put it on the top of my resume).

The presentation/paper part is also great. The best opportunity for me to know more about the web development ecosystem and these emerging complicated stuffs.


2. What could be improved?

When I was first in touch with modern JS, all these stuff I did in in-class exercises (webpack, node modules, etc.) kind of make me confused. Make it slower at the beginning would be very helpful, since there are too much stuff to get familiar.

Analougously, it's really a huge difference between inclass-10/inclass-11 and HW5/HW6. To fill out the gap, it does take me too much time. What about dividing HW5 into two homeworks, thus the first one could make students more familiar with React/Redux stuff.

One very important part is that how to slow down a bit during class time. I remember once you explained each line of code very detailtedly, in a back-end class. That time we followed you pretty well. Otherwise, sometiems I have to go over your provided code in class again to figure out what you mean.
