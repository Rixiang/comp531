1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?
Talk 1, User Experience.
The presenter prepared well, by offering a delicate PowerPoint and specific research on websites like Amazon.

2. Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?
Talk 7, CSS Frameworks.
The presenter discussed Bootstrap, Foundation, and Semantic UI detailedly. All their respective pros and cons are listed clearly.
One great part is that Jinhao give suggesstions on slect which framework for different developers and projects.

3. Which talk did you like the best and why?
Test 14, Testing framworks.
I think it is due to the topic the presenter picked. Web testing framwork is something I know some bit (practiced in assignments) but not very familiar with. QUnit, Mocha, and Jasmine seems interesting when put together. Hopefully I would have the opportunity to user Jasmine in future.
